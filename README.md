# Maggi-Weather
Finally, after a long wait, I got a chance to experiment with a new ui design technique through my project "Maggi weather". It's a weather web app that allows you to check the hourly and weekly weather of different cities. Along with it, you can enjoy different ui's at a different time of the day.
